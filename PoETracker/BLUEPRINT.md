# Implementation blueprint 🚀🚀🚀

1. Make a parser for Client.txt that processes information from today's date
2. Make sure that the parser doesn't parse whole of Client.txt every time you run the program.
3. Make code to instantiate the DB.
4. Extract fun data from the parsed information like level ups, deaths etc.
5. Setup database transactions that store this data.

### Keywords to regex for

    - Slain. How many times have I died?
    - ("ClassName") is now level "number". How many times have I leveled up?
    - Successfully allocated passive skill id: mana1478, name: Primal Spirit. Make a heatmap of most allocated passive points?
    Maybe render the skill tree marking the most allocated points, like in Path of Building.

Complaints about C#:

    Why is the Regex class immutable after instantiation?
    Why can you call the Regex constructor with no parameters from only classes derived from the Regex class?
